# Project Portfolio

The objective of this project is to create a personal portfolio for a developer and designer called "Lobo". The portfolio presents information about the developer's experience, education, and contact details, using HTML and CSS for the structure and styling of the page.

Here's a summary of what was done:

## HTML Structure:

- An `index.html` file was created to define the basic structure of the web page.


## CSS Styling:

- The CSS file (`style.css`) referenced in the `<head>` is responsible for defining the visual style of the page, such as colors, fonts, spacing, etc.
- - The `style.css` file imports several other CSS files to modularize the styling.

This project serves as an example of how to create a simple and effective personal portfolio, using HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The page is designed to be responsive and accessible, with clear navigation and well-organized information about the developer.
